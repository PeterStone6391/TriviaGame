// Come up with 10 questions------ Choose Disney
// come up with the possible answers for each question-----  Found some questions on a Buzzfeed quiz that has three wrong and one right answer https://www.buzzfeed.com/briangalindo/the-ultimate-disney-trivia-quiz
// function to start game
// timer for page for question
// on click event when they select answer
// check user input vs correct answer to question (results at the end of the game)
// once answered call new page with new question
// repeat these steps until final question in the array
// once array is complete launch results page
// alert or some action for victory maybe 7/10 or better and the opposite for defeat
// function to restart the game to play again------still need help on this one

//create array of objects(one question and 4 possible answers and one correct answers)

// doing the single page instead, seemed easier------
// write the jQuery next
// practice write functions 50 times this weekend per tutor Michael------done!
